This theme uses libsass/gulp to process the sass/*.scss. Never edit any of the .css files manually.

#### Editing the theme

* Install `nvm` (https://github.com/creationix/nvm)

* Run `nvm i` from the directory containing `.nvmrc`

* Run `npm i` from the directory containing `gulpfile.js`. It's the same directory as the one that contains `.nvmrc` in this case.

* Install `gulp` with `npm i -g gulp`

* Edit the sass/*.scss files

* Regenerate the .css files by executing `gulp` from the directory that contains `gulpfile.js`
