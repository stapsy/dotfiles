A very bright and simple (but daily useable) theme inspired by Elegant Brit.

##### Themes available:

* GTK2 - depends on the gtk2 pixbuf & mist engines
* GTK3 - totally unsupported
* Xfwm4
* Marco/Metacity
* Openbox
* Xfce Notify
* MPlayer
* KDM
* SLiM

##### How to get the files?:

**Open a Terminal:**

Enter the theme dir: **`cd ~/.themes`**

Get the theme: **`svn co https://github.com/sixsixfive/simpliX/trunk simpliX`**

**NOTE:**
You should now be able to set the GTK2, Xfwm, Xfce-Notify, Marco and Openbox themes in your
desktop settings (keep in mind that the gtk2 theme has a settings file) all other themes are located in ~/.themes/simpliX/Extras
