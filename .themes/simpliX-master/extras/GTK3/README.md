#####Howto:

Just copy the "simpliX" folders to the theme dirs. (eg: $HOME/.themes/simpliX/gtk-3.0)

#####Theme dirs:

* GTK3 **`$HOME/.themes`**, **`$HOME/.local/themes`** or **`$SYSPREFIX/themes`** 

#####Note:

* the GTK3 theme may or may not work, srsly I don't care anymore :P
* there is a settings.ini in each GTK theme dir for a few options
