Numix, but modified to use the colors from the base16 color scheme. Tested against gtk2, but should work with gtk3, metacity, openbox, unity, xfce-notify, and xfwm4. 

### Usage

#### Global install

    git clone git@github.com:robertseaton/numix-base16.git
    sudo cp -r numix-base16 /usr/share/themes
    
#### Local install (untested)

    git clone git@github.com:robertseaton/numix-base16.git
    cp -r numix-base16 ~/.themes

Then update your running theme with a program like `lxappearance` or `gtk-chtheme`.
